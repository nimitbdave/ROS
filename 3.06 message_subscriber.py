"""
Importing your new message type works just like including a standard ROS message
type and allows you to create a message instance just like any other Python class.

Once youâ€™ve created the instance, you can fill in the values for the individual fields.
(Any fields that are not explicitly assigned a value should be considered to have an
undefined value.)

Subscribing to and using your new message is similarly easy, as shown in 3.06, here.
