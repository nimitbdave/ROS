The subscriber and publisher are set up as before, but now weâ€™re going to publish data
in the callback, rather than periodically. The idea behind this is that we only want to
publish when we have new data coming in, since the purpose of this node is to transform
data (in this case, by doubling the number that comes in on the subscribed
topic).
